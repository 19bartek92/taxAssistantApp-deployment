### Email Template
```
Subject: TaxAssistantApp Deployment - Publish Profile

Hi [Developer],

I've successfully deployed the TaxAssistantApp infrastructure to Azure.

Deployment Details:
- Resource Group: [your-resource-group-name]
- Web App Name: [your-web-app-name]
- App URL: [your-app-url]

Please find the publish profile attached (encrypted/password-protected).
Password: [if applicable]

The infrastructure is ready for application deployment.

Best regards,
[Your name]
```

## üîß Developer Instructions

For the developer deploying the application:

1. **Extract** the publish profile file
2. **Build** the application: `dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish`
3. **Deploy** using Azure CLI:
   ```bash
   az webapp deploy \
     --resource-group [resource-group-name] \
     --name [web-app-name] \
     --src-path ./publish \
     --type zip
   ```

## üåê Access Your Application

After the developer deploys the code, your application will be available at:
```
https://[your-web-app-name].azurewebsites.net
```

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Deployment fails with "Key Vault name not available"**
A: Key Vault names must be globally unique. Try a different name or let the system generate one.

**Q: Can't download publish profile**
A: F1 (Free) tier has limited publish options. You can still deploy using Visual Studio Code with Azure extension or Azure CLI with deployment center.

**Q: App shows error after deployment**
A: The infrastructure is created, but the application code needs to be deployed by the developer.

**Q: API keys not working**
A: Double-check that you've entered the correct NSA API keys during deployment.

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the Azure Portal ‚Üí Resource Group ‚Üí Deployments for error details
2. Contact your developer with the error message
3. Ensure all required parameters were filled correctly

## üîí Security Notes

- API keys are stored securely in Azure Key Vault
- The application uses Managed Identity to access secrets
- All connections use HTTPS
- Publish profile contains temporary deployment credentials
